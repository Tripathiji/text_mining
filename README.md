# text_mining
This project consists of providing solutions to a business problem using text mining in R and natural language processing. Business Problem: We are a consultant team that got hired by a startup who is trying to launch a new business in the alcoholic beverage industry. Weâ€™re trying to understand alcohol consumption patterns in San Francisco.

Kindly download and extract Hult_data_mining.zip on your desktop and set it as the working directory.

For R.Script

Step 1: Open RStudio

Step 2: File > Open File > Hult_data_mining > Hult_data_mining.R

Step 3: Under '#### Prep Work ####' go through the libraries, and install all dependencies

Step 4: setwd is your directory. Set it to Hult_data_mining folder path.

Step 5: nm is your PDF folder. Set the path as the PDF folder within Hult_data_mining pdf folder.

Step 6: Team1-12 is the collected text. Set the file path as Hult_data_mining folder, keep the '/Team(n).txt'.

Step 7: Enjoy rest of the R.Script. Every analysis is categorized and named in order.

For Shiny

Step 1: After running all the R.Script find Hult_data_mining_Shiny folder and run server.R first followed by ui.R

Step 2: If you have ran every analysis in R.Script, Shiny should just load up when you "Run App" . It runs through the images in Global Environment created by R.script.

If you are unable to download the app and run it then please visit https://adhishtripathiji.shinyapps.io/Hult_data_mining/ where the app is deployed and running on a Shiny server.
